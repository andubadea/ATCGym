# bluesky_gym
The main source code of the gym environment. 

Contains the envs and scripts folders where the scenarios/environments and the training loops are respectively. 

Additional folders in the future could be /airspace, /aircraft or similar folders where common objects that are used by multiple environments are stored, but this is open for discussion (an alternative would be a '/common' folder in /envs)
